# Pokémon _____: Special Eevee Edition

Name ideas:

* Spectrum (romhack exists with this name)
* Prism (romhack exists with this name)
* Brown (romhack exists with this name)
* Beige (joke exists with this name)

This is a romhack of Pokémon Yellow based on the disassembly by the pret team.

The story goes: instead of finding a wild Pikachu and an Eevee waiting in a ball, Oak has a Pikachu waiting in a ball and finds a wild Eevee. The result is that the player starts with an Eevee and the rival starts with a Pikachu.

Most of the code changes are done, the hard part of this romhack is replacing the Pikachu art and audio assets with Eevee equivalents. I have worked out how to change the art but recreating authentic sound files is proving more challenging.
